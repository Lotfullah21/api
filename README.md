# Rest API Documentation

Welcome to the **Rest API Documentation** repository! This repository contains detailed documentation for building and managing RESTful APIs using Django Rest Framework (DRF) with authentication, serialization, and various advanced features like filtering, pagination, and caching.

This documentation is organized into several key sections to help developers build scalable and maintainable APIs for applications like online learning platforms, It covers topics such as authentication, search filtering, API serialization, validation, and much more.
