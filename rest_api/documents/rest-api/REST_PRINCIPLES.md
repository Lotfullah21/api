# 🌟 Best Practices for API Development

## 🛠 General Best Practices

### 1️⃣ Keep it Simple

- The API design should be intuitive and straightforward.

### 2️⃣ One API, One Job

- Each API endpoint should handle a single, clear purpose.

### 3️⃣ Include Filtering, Ordering, and Pagination

- Make it easy to retrieve data efficiently:
  - **Filtering**: `/users?role=admin`
  - **Ordering**: `/users?sort=created_at`
  - **Pagination**: `/users?page=1&limit=10`

### 4️⃣ Make the API Cacheable

- Use caching mechanisms (e.g., HTTP cache headers) to reduce server load and improve response times.

### 5️⃣ Implement Rate Limiting

- Protect your API from abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.

### 6️⃣ Monitor Latency

- Regularly track API latency to ensure fast responses and a good user experience.
