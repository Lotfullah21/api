# 🌐 HTTP & HTTPS Guide

## 🛠 What is HTTP?

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of communication on the web. It allows clients (like browsers) to communicate with servers to request and retrieve resources such as web pages, images, or data.

### ✨ Key Features of HTTP:

- Stateless: Each request is independent, with no memory of previous interactions.
- Flexible: Supports different methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.
- Plaintext: Data is sent in plaintext, which makes it less secure.

## 🔒 What is HTTPS?

**HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts data using **SSL/TLS**, ensuring safe communication between clients and servers.

### 🌟 Benefits of HTTPS:

- 🔐 **Encryption**: Protects sensitive data like passwords and payment details.
- ✅ **Authentication**: Verifies the website’s identity via SSL certificates.
- 🚀 **Trust & SEO**: Boosts user trust and improves search engine ranking.

## 📨 HTTP Response Types

When a client sends a request, the server responds with a **status code** and data. These codes are grouped into categories:

### 🔢 Response Types & Examples:

#### **1xx (Informational)**

The request is received, and the server is processing it.

- `100 Continue`: The server is ready to receive the rest of the request.
- `101 Switching Protocols`: The server is changing protocols as requested.

#### **2xx (Success)**

The request was successfully processed.

- `200 OK`: Standard success response.
- `201 Created`: A resource has been created.
- `204 No Content`: The request was successful, but there's no content to return.

#### **3xx (Redirection)**

Further action is needed to complete the request.

- `301 Moved Permanently`: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- `302 Found`: The resource is temporarily at a different URL.
- `304 Not Modified`: The resource has not changed since the last request.

#### **4xx (Client Errors)**

The request has an issue due to incorrect input or permissions.

- `400 Bad Request`: The server cannot process the malformed request.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required.
- `402 Payment Required`: Reserved for future use (e.g., payment processing).
- `403 Forbidden`: Access is denied to the resource.
- `404 Not Found`: The resource does not exist.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: The client has sent too many requests in a given time.

#### **5xx (Server Errors)**

The server encountered an error while processing the request.

- `500 Internal Server Error`: General server-side error.
- `502 Bad Gateway`: The server received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: The server is temporarily unavailable (e.g., maintenance).
- `504 Gateway Timeout`: The server didn't receive a timely response from another server.
