# üåê HTTP & HTTPS Guide

## üõ† What is HTTP?

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** is the foundation of communication on the web. It allows clients (like browsers) to communicate with servers to request and retrieve resources such as web pages, images, or data.

### ‚ú® Key Features of HTTP:

- Stateless: Each request is independent, with no memory of previous interactions.
- Flexible: Supports different methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, etc.
- Plaintext: Data is sent in plaintext, which makes it less secure.

## üîí What is HTTPS?

**HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)** is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts data using **SSL/TLS**, ensuring safe communication between clients and servers.

### üåü Benefits of HTTPS:

- üîê **Encryption**: Protects sensitive data like passwords and payment details.
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Verifies the website‚Äôs identity via SSL certificates.
- üöÄ **Trust & SEO**: Boosts user trust and improves search engine ranking.

## üì® HTTP Response Types

When a client sends a request, the server responds with a **status code** and data. These codes are grouped into categories:

### üî¢ Response Types & Examples:

#### **1xx (Informational)**

The request is received, and the server is processing it.

- `100 Continue`: The server is ready to receive the rest of the request.
- `101 Switching Protocols`: The server is changing protocols as requested.

#### **2xx (Success)**

The request was successfully processed.

- `200 OK`: Standard success response.
- `201 Created`: A resource has been created.
- `204 No Content`: The request was successful, but there's no content to return.

#### **3xx (Redirection)**

Further action is needed to complete the request.

- `301 Moved Permanently`: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- `302 Found`: The resource is temporarily at a different URL.
- `304 Not Modified`: The resource has not changed since the last request.

#### **4xx (Client Errors)**

The request has an issue due to incorrect input or permissions.

- `400 Bad Request`: The server cannot process the malformed request.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required.
- `402 Payment Required`: Reserved for future use (e.g., payment processing).
- `403 Forbidden`: Access is denied to the resource.
- `404 Not Found`: The resource does not exist.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: The client has sent too many requests in a given time.

#### **5xx (Server Errors)**

The server encountered an error while processing the request.

- `500 Internal Server Error`: General server-side error.
- `502 Bad Gateway`: The server received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: The server is temporarily unavailable (e.g., maintenance).
- `504 Gateway Timeout`: The server didn't receive a timely response from another server.

## HTTPS

While making a request to a browser or submit a form, our data is transmitted using `HTTP` or `HTTPS`.

To make a request-response successful, we need two parts, one to make a request (client) and the other one to send an answer to the request (server).
`HTTPS` is secured version of `HTTP`, where client's computer encrypts data before sending the request and the server decrypts the request and sends an encrypted response.

# ## HTTP methods (http verbs)

HTTP methods or request types tell the API endpoint what it should do with the resources. It defines the action.
there are five common methods

### 1. GET

To get the resources from the server

### 2. POST

To post a content

### 3. UPDATE

To update the content

### 4. PATCH

To partially update the content

### 5. DELETE

To delete the content

## HTTP Request

```table

It contains different kind of information that the user's browser sends as encoded data.
A typical http request contains the following

- http version type
- url
- http method
- request headers
- optional body

| **HTTP Method** | **Action**                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GET**         | Returns the requested resource. If the resource is not found, it returns a 404 Not Found status code.                                                    |
| **POST**        | Creates a new resource. It includes a payload (JSON or Form URL encoded data). Multiple resources can be created, but it's not considered best practice. |
| **PUT**         | Replaces an existing resource with the provided data. The request contains all data for the resource and updates the resource entirely.                  |
| **PATCH**       | Updates part of an existing resource. Unlike PUT, it only modifies certain fields of the resource.                                                       |
| **DELETE**      | Deletes the specified resource.                                                                                                                          |
```

We are making a request, our data is passed to the server through http body.
request headers contains extra information for the server to make a decision, some examples of request headers are `cookies`, `user-agents` and `referrers`.

```table
| **HTTP Method** | **Sample Endpoints**                       | **Query String / Payload**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **GET**         | `/api/courses`<br>`/api/courses/1`<br>`/api/courses?category=programming`<br>`/api/courses?perpage=3&page=2`                   | A GET call doesn‚Äôt need a payload. However, it can include query string parameters to filter the API output (e.g., by category or pagination).                                                                                                                       |
| **POST**        | `/api/courses`<br>`/api/enrollments`        | Here‚Äôs a sample JSON payload for the `/api/courses` endpoint to create a new resource: <br><br> `{ "title": "Python for Beginners", "duration": 30, "category": "programming" }`                                                                                       |
| **PUT**         | `/api/courses/1`<br>`/api/enrollments/1`    | Here‚Äôs a sample JSON payload for the `/api/courses/1` endpoint to completely replace it: <br><br> `{ "title": "Advanced Python", "duration": 45, "category": "programming" }`                                                                                           |

| **DELETE**      | `/api/courses`<br>`/api/courses/1`<br>`/api/enrollments`<br>`/api/enrollments/1` | When a DELETE call is sent to a collection endpoint like `/api/courses`, it should delete the entire collection. When sent to a specific resource like `/api/courses/1`, it deletes only that resource.                                                                 |

```

## HTTP Response

It consists of information that the browser uses to display the content for the user.
Sending appropriate status codes with every API response is essential and Every status code has meaning
the response contains

- requested resource
- content length
- content type
- headers like cookies
- http status code
- time that the content was last modified
- ETags

### Response types

The most common response types involved with REST APIs are JSON, XML, plain text, and sometimes YAML.
While making an API call, the client can specify its desired response format with the Accept HTTP header. And that header should be considered to deliver the result in that format using the render classes. Here‚Äôs a list of HTTP headers for different response types.

```table
| **Response Type** | **Request Header**                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **HTML**          | `Accept: text/html`                        |
| **JSON and JSONP**| `Accept: application/json`                 |
| **XML**           | `Accept: application/xml`<br>`Accept: text/xml` |
| **YAML**          | `Accept: application/yaml`<br>`Accept: application/x-yaml`<br>`Accept: text/yaml` |

```

### HTTP Status Code

they provide extra information to the browser about the resource that was requested for.
for instance `200` means everything is ok and many other status code.

- `100-199` for information messages
- `200-299` for successful responses
- `300-399` for redirection information
- `400-499` for errors on client side
- `500-599` for errors on server side

```table
| **Status Code Range** | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **100-199**           | This range is mainly used to pass on information. For example, a 102 ‚Äì Processing status code can be returned to inform the client that the result isn't ready and should be checked again.                                      |
| **200-299**           | These are success codes. For example, 200 ‚Äì OK for a successful PUT, PATCH, or DELETE call, and 201 ‚Äì Created for a successful POST call when a resource has been created.                                                     |
| **300-399**           | These are redirection codes. For instance, 301 ‚Äì Moved Permanently can redirect the client to a new endpoint if the original one has changed.                                                                                  |
| **400-499**           | Client error codes. Common examples include: 404 ‚Äì Not Found for non-existent resources, 400 ‚Äì Bad Request for invalid payloads, 401 ‚Äì Unauthorized for authentication issues, and 403 ‚Äì Forbidden for unauthorized actions.    |
| **500-599**           | Server error codes, indicating something went wrong on the server side. These are usually caused by unhandled exceptions or server misconfigurations. API developers should aim to avoid 5xx errors by handling edge cases.      |

```

## üöÄ Why Choose HTTPS?

With cyber threats increasing daily, **HTTPS** is the standard for secure and trustworthy web communication. It‚Äôs essential for modern web applications.

üåü **Pro Tip**: Always use HTTPS, especially if your site handles sensitive information!
